	abstract = {We describe the operation of an electrodynamic ion trap in which the electric quadrupole field oscillates at two frequencies. This mode of operation allows simultaneous tight confinement of ions with extremely different charge-to-mass ratios, e.g., singly ionised atomic ions together with multiply charged nanoparticles. We derive the stability conditions for two-frequency operation from asymptotic properties of the solutions of the Mathieu equation and give a general treatment of the effect of damping on parametric resonances. Two-frequency operation is effective when the two species’ mass ratios and charge ratios are sufficiently large, and further when the frequencies required to optimally trap each species are widely separated. This system resembles two coincident Paul traps, each operating close to a frequency optimised for one of the species, such that both species are tightly confined. This method of operation provides an advantage over single-frequency Paul traps, in which the more weakly confined species forms a sheath around a central core of tightly confined ions. We verify these ideas using numerical simulations and by measuring the parametric heating induced in experiments by the additional driving frequency.}

In this last lecture, assumptions about the atomic motion were made, which were directly inspired by the situation of ions trapped in an Radiofrequency (RF) quadrupole trap. Nevertheless, the motion of ions in Penning traps has a lot to share with the motion in RF quadrupole traps, mostly its harmonic nature. As a consequence, methods explained in this last context can be adapted to ions in Penning traps. The spirit of this chapter is to start from the fundamental basic equations to allow the reader to derive the formulae in his own specific context. One of the goals is to identify the parameters that control the relevant orders of magnitude that need to be estimated before building a laser cooling set-up. }
